# Library-Management
This repository contains a Library Management System project implemented using SQL. The project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for managing library operations, including book cataloging, borrower management, check-in and check-out processes, and generating reports.

## Features:

Book Management: The system allows the librarian to add, update, and delete books from the library catalog. Each book entry includes details such as title, author, genre, publication year, and availability status.

Borrower Management: The system enables the librarian to manage borrower information. It allows adding, modifying, and deleting borrower records, including details like name, contact information, and membership status.

Check-In and Check-Out: The system facilitates the borrowing and returning of books by keeping track of loan transactions. It manages due dates, late returns, and fines for overdue books.

Reservation System: Users can reserve books that are currently unavailable. Once a reserved book becomes available, the system notifies the respective borrower.

Reporting: The system provides various reports to assist in library administration, such as a list of overdue books, borrowed books, reserved books, and borrower statistics.

Search and Filtering: Users can search for books based on title, author, genre, or any other relevant criteria. The system supports advanced filtering options to refine search results.

## Technologies Used:

SQL: The project is implemented using SQL for managing the database, defining tables, and executing queries.
Database Management System: The project assumes the usage of a specific DBMS, such as MySQL
